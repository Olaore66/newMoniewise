/**
 * Payeelord transaction-webhook receiver — lives alongside {@link WebhookController}
 * in the {@code /api/webhooks} family but is split into its own class since it backs
 * a self-contained VAS slice (mirrors how Rubies/Providus/SecureWave share one
 * controller while having very different downstream processing).
 *
 * <h3>This is an audit trail, not a settlement signal</h3>
 * Payeelord's airtime/data purchase endpoints respond <b>synchronously</b> —
 * {@code PayeelordVasService#purchaseAirtime}/{@code purchaseData} already drove the
 * transaction to its terminal (or pending-ambiguous) state from that HTTP response
 * before this webhook could possibly arrive. Payeelord's own docs describe the
 * webhook firing "only after the purchase endpoint returns its JSON response".
 * So this endpoint exists purely to stamp a {@code webhookConfirmedAt} audit marker
 * — see {@link PayeelordVasService#recordWebhookConfirmation}.
 *
 * <h3>Signature header — name UNCONFIRMED, fails open</h3>
 * Payeelord's documentation confirms only that "webhook signatures use your current
 * API key as the HMAC secret" — it does not name the carrier header or hash
 * algorithm. Mirroring the Providus precedent (whose header was equally
 * undocumented at integration time, see {@link WebhookController#handleProvidusWebhook}),
 * this endpoint accepts several plausible candidates and forwards whichever is
 * non-blank to {@link PayeelordGateway#validateWebhookSignature}, which itself
 * fails open (accepts + logs a security warning) until the scheme is confirmed
 * against a captured live delivery.
 *
 * <p>The endpoint always returns {@code 200 OK} once the signature check passes —
 * including when downstream processing throws — so Payeelord does not retry
 * indefinitely; a bad signature returns {@code 401} so Payeelord knows the
 * delivery was received but rejected.
 *
 * <p><b>Give Payeelord this URL:</b>
 * {@code https://your-render-domain.onrender.com/api/webhooks/payeelord}
