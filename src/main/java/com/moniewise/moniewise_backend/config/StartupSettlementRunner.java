/**
 * On every application startup, automatically settles any EXT- envelope external
 * transfers that are stuck in {@code PROCESSING} status.
 *
 * <h3>Why this is needed</h3>
 * <p>When the Rubies DR webhook was rejected (HTTP 500 — the duplicate provider_reference
 * bug) Rubies stopped retrying, leaving EXT- TransactionLogs permanently in PROCESSING.
 * After that bug was fixed (V16 migration + EnvelopeService change), new transfers work
 * correctly — but historical stuck records must still be recovered.
 *
 * <p>This runner performs the same work as {@code POST /admin/rubies/settle-stuck} but
 * runs automatically so no manual Postman call is required after each deploy.
 *
 * <h3>What it does on each startup</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Finds all PROCESSING EXT- TransactionLogs that have a {@code sourceEnvelopeId}
 *       (i.e. envelope external transfers, not wallet withdrawals) and are at least
 *       {@value #MIN_AGE_MINUTES} minutes old (to avoid racing genuinely in-flight
 *       transfers that were initiated seconds before the server restarted).</li>
 *   <li>Calls {@code settleExternalTransfer(ref, "SUCCESS")} for each one, which:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>Marks the TransactionLog COMPLETED</li>
 *         <li>Releases the envelope's held amount and reduces totalRemainingAmount</li>
 *         <li>Reduces the parent budget's remaining_amount (V18 fix)</li>
 *         <li>Credits the ₦2.25 markup fee to the revenue wallet DB record</li>
 *         <li>Fires {@code collectRubiesMarkupFeeAsync} — the Rubies P2P to transfer
 *             the markup fee to the Moniewise Rubies revenue account</li>
 *       </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Safety guards</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Runs {@link Async} so it never delays application startup.</li>
 *   <li>Only touches records older than {@value #MIN_AGE_MINUTES} minutes — transfers
 *       submitted in the last few minutes may still be genuinely in-flight on Rubies.</li>
 *   <li>{@code settleExternalTransfer} is idempotent: already-COMPLETED records are
 *       skipped immediately, so re-running on every startup is safe.</li>
 * </ul>
